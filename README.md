# JS Training with TDD

Credits: [Clément Denis](https://github.com/kigiri) for the [original repo](https://github.com/nan-academy/js-training).

## Setup

**Prerequisites**: you must have installed Git!

Node.js is a platform which makes it possible to run JavaScript code outside the web browser.

You have to install Node.js, preferably **not** with the packages on Node's download page.

### Install Node.js on Linux/MacOS

**Note for Linux users**: before going further, run `which curl` in the terminal. If it shows something (e.g. `/usr/bin/curl`), you're good! Otherwise, run `sudo apt install -y curl` (Ubuntu/Debian) to install cURL.

You are going to use NVM (Node Version Manager). Here's a summary of what you have to do (see [installation instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installation-and-update) on the NVM repo for more details). Run these commands in your terminal:

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install v10.16.3
nvm use v10.16.3
```

You can verify that it worked by running `node -v`, which should display:

    v10.16.3

### Install Node.js on Windows

The original NVM doesn't support Windows. You're going to use [NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows). Get to the [releases page](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases). Under the latest version (1.1.7 as of September 2019), download the `nvm-setup.zip` file (or use this [direct link](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases/download/1.1.7/nvm-setup.zip)).

Extract the archive, and run `nvm-setup.exe`. Complete the setup wizard. Then, quit Git Bash if it is running, re-launch it, and type:

```sh
nvm install v10.16.3
nvm use v10.16.3
```

Running `node -v` should display: `v10.16.3`.

### Get this repo

First, [**fork**](https://github.com/WildCodeSchool/js-training-tdd/fork?fragment=1) this repository: you'll then have a copy of this repo under your GitHub account.

Then go to wherever you store your development work, and run these commands to clone the forked repo (replace `GITHUB_LOGIN` with your login):

```sh
# download your code locally
git clone https://github.com/GITHUB_LOGIN/js-training-tdd.git

# change working directory to the newly cloned repository
cd js-training-tdd
```

## Testing

Once you have coded your masterpiece, you can start testing your solutions.

You can run tests for a single section:
```sh
# run the test runner with args ( basics, advanced, math, get)
./tester basics
```

**Later on**, you may use `tester` with no argument, to check exercises from _all_ sections (in this example, `basics`, `math` and part of `str` have been solved):

```sh
# run the test runner
./tester
```

## Solving

You can start editing the JavaScript files with your favorite text editor i.e. VSCode, Atom, Sublime Text, etc.

We maintain an example-based code documentation

All you need to know to solve those exercises is described in them.
- [Primitive and Operators](https://github.com/WildCodeSchool/js-training-tdd/blob/master/examples/primitive-and-operators.js)
- [Variables](https://github.com/WildCodeSchool/js-training-tdd/blob/master/examples/variables.js)
- [Data-Structures](https://github.com/WildCodeSchool/js-training-tdd/blob/master/examples/data-structures.js)

They must be used with caution as it is harder to predict their results_
